{{lowercase}}
{{cd|'''server.properties'''}} is a file that specifies settings for the ''Minecraft'' [[server]] software. There exists a variant for [[server.jar]] in {{JE}}, as well as for [[Bedrock Dedicated Server]] in {{BE}}. Those variants are not compatible, but serve a similar purpose with similar syntax.

==''Java Edition''==

{{cd|server.properties}} is located in the current working directory of the server software. That means if the server is started from some directory, the file will be also placed in that directory.

The file is {{w|UTF-8}} encoded text using the [[w:.properties|Properties]] syntax, as defined for <code>[https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Properties.html#load(java.io.Reader) Properties.load(Reader)]</code>. It can be edited with a text editor, such as Notepad, TextEdit, Kate, nano or Vim.

The software first attempts to load the file as UTF-8, but if that fails, ISO-8859-1 is used as a fallback.

The syntax generally consists of line (LF, CR, or CRLF) separated key-value pairs, separated by an <code>=</code> sign. The key is the setting identifier, and the value is used for that setting. All values are strings, but they might be interpreted as integers or other types by the software, depending on the key. Lines starting with <code>#</code> are comments and are ignored.

The {{cd|server.properties}} file is regenerated by the server software on startup:

# If the file already exists, existing values are copied from it. Comments are ignored.
# Any missing keys or keys with invalid values are set to the defaults.
# The file is rewritten with UTF-8 encoding. This has the effects of <code>[https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Properties.html#store(java.io.Writer,java.lang.String) Properties.store(Writer, String)]</code>, including:
#* On the first line, a comment <code>Minecraft server properties</code> is written. The text of the comment is provided by the server software.
#* On the second line, a comment containing the timestamp of the file's generation in the format <code>dow mon dd hh:mm:ss zzz yyyy</code> in Java's <code>[https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html DateTimeFormatter]</code> pattern syntax is written.
#* Some characters such as <code>:</code> are escaped in values with <code>\</code>.
#* Line endings are written as LF on Unix-like systems, and as CRLF on Windows.

After changes are made to the file, the server must be restarted for them to take effect.

===Keys===

{| class="wikitable stikitable collapsible" data-description="Server properties"
|-
!Key
!Type
!Default Value
!Description

|- id="accepts-transfers"
|'''accepts-transfers'''
|boolean
|false
|Whether to accept incoming transfers via a transfer packet.
:'''false''' - Incoming transfers are rejected, and the player is disconnected.
:'''true''' - Incoming transfers are allowed, and the server must approve it.

|- id="allow-flight"
|'''allow-flight'''
|boolean
|false
|Whether players can use flight on the server while in Survival mode by using [[mod]]s.
With allow-flight enabled, [[griefers]] may become more common, because it makes their work easier. In Creative mode, this has no effect.
:'''false''' - Flight is not allowed (players in air for at least 5 seconds get kicked).
:'''true''' - Flight is allowed, and used if the player has a fly mod installed.

|- id="broadcast-console-to-ops"
|'''broadcast-console-to-ops'''
|boolean
|true
|Whether to send console command outputs to all [[Server#Managing_and_maintaining_a_server|online operators]].

|- id="broadcast-rcon-to-ops"
|'''broadcast-rcon-to-ops'''
|boolean
|true
|Whether to send rcon console command outputs to all online operators.

|- id="bug-report-link"
|'''bug-report-link'''
|string
|''blank''
|The URL for the <code>report_bug</code> server link.

If empty, the link is not sent.

|- id="difficulty"
|'''difficulty'''
|string
|easy
|The [[difficulty]] (such as damage dealt by mobs and the way hunger and poison affects players) of the server.

If a legacy difficulty number is specified, it is silently converted to a difficulty name.

:'''peaceful''' (0)
:'''easy''' (1)
:'''normal''' (2)
:'''hard''' (3)

|- id="enable-code-of-conduct"
|'''enable-code-of-conduct'''
|boolean
|false
|Whether the server will look for code of conduct files in the {{code|codeofconduct}} subfolder in the {{code|server.properties}} folder.

Each file in the folder should have the form {{code|<language_code>.txt}}. The server will then show the code of conduct matching the player’s language. If the language doesn’t exist, then {{code|en_us}} will be used. If neither exist, an arbitrary available entry will be used instead.

|- id="enable-jmx-monitoring"
|'''enable-jmx-monitoring'''
|boolean
|false
|Whether to expose an MBean with the Object name <code>net.minecraft.server:type=Server</code> and two attributes <code>averageTickTime</code> and <code>tickTimes</code> exposing the tick times in milliseconds.

In order to enable JMX on the Java runtime you also need to use certain JVM flags: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/management/agent.html.

|- id="enable-query"
|'''enable-query'''
|boolean
|false
|Whether to enable [[query]], which provides information about the server.

|- id="enable-rcon"
|'''enable-rcon'''
|boolean
|false
|Whether to enable rcon, which allows access to the server console over a network.

It's not recommended to connect to rcon via untrusted networks, like the internet, as it is not encrypted. All data sent between the client and the server (including the rcon password) can be intercepted. Ideally, only connect to rcon from localhost.

|- id="enable-status"
|'''enable-status'''
|boolean
|true
|Whether the server appears as "online" on the server list.

If set to false, status replies to clients are suppressed. This means the server appears as offline, but still accepts connections.

|- id="enforce-secure-profile"
|'''enforce-secure-profile'''
|boolean
|true
|Whether to only allow players with a Mojang-signed public key to join the server.

If this is not enabled, all chat messages will be left unsigned and unable to be reported. Clients will get warned about this when connecting to the server.

|- id="enforce-whitelist"
|'''enforce-whitelist'''
|boolean
|false
|Whether to enforce changes to the whitelist.

When this option as well as the whitelist is enabled, players not present on the whitelist get kicked from the server after the server reloads the whitelist file.

:'''false''' - Online players that are not on the whitelist are not kicked.
:'''true''' - Online players that are not on the whitelist are kicked.

|- id="entity-broadcast-range-percentage"
|'''entity-broadcast-range-percentage'''
|integer (10-1000)
|100
|How close entities need to be to the player to be sent.

Higher values means they'll be rendered from farther away, potentially causing more lag.

This is expressed as a percentage. For example, setting to 50 makes entites only render at half the usual distance. This mimics the function on the client video settings (not unlike Render Distance, which the client can customize so long as it's under the server's setting).

|- id="force-gamemode"
|'''force-gamemode'''
|boolean
|false
|Whether to switch players to the default [[game mode]] on join.

:'''false''' - Players join in the game mode they left in.
:'''true''' - Players always join in the default game mode.

|- id="function-permission-level"
|'''function-permission-level'''
|integer (1-4)
|2
|The default permission level for [[Function (Java Edition)|functions]].

See [[permission level]] for the details on the 4 levels.

|- id="gamemode"
|'''gamemode'''
|string
|survival
|The default [[game mode]].
If a legacy game mode number is specified, it is silently converted to a game mode name.

:'''[[survival]]''' (0)
:'''[[creative]]''' (1)
:'''[[adventure]]''' (2)
:'''[[spectator]]''' (3)

|- id="generate-structures"
|'''generate-structures'''
|boolean
|true
|Whether [[structures]] (such as villages) are generated.

:'''false''' - Structures are not generated in new chunks.
:'''true''' - Structures are generated in new chunks.

'''Note:''' ''Dungeons still generate if this is set to false.''

|- id="generator-settings"
|'''generator-settings'''
|string
|{}
|Settings used to customize world generation.

Use depends on chosen '''level-type'''. For '''minecraft:flat''', see [[Superflat#Multiplayer]].

|- id="hardcore"
|'''hardcore'''
|boolean
|false
|Whether to enable [[hardcore]] mode on created worlds.

|- id="hide-online-players"
|'''hide-online-players'''
|boolean
|false
|Whether to disable sending the player list on status requests.

|- id="initial-disabled-packs"
|'''initial-disabled-packs'''
|string
|''blank''
|Datapacks to not be auto-enabled on world creation.

Specified as a comma-separated list.

|- id="initial-enabled-packs"
|'''initial-enabled-packs'''
|string
|vanilla
|Datapacks to be enabled on world creation.

Specified as a comma-separated list. Feature packs need to be explicitly enabled.

|- id="level-name"
|'''level-name'''
|string
|world
|The world name and the world directory path.

If a directory at this path exists and is a valid world, it will be loaded by the server. Otherwise, the server will generate a new world in this directory (creating the directory and it's parents if necessary) and use the provided value as it's name.

This can be both an absolute path, or a path relative to the working directory or the value of the <code>--universe</code> [[server.jar#Command line options|command line option]] if provided.

|- id="level-seed"
|'''level-seed'''
|string
|''blank''
|The [[world seed|seed]] for the generated world.

A random seed is used if left blank.

|- id="level-type"
|'''level-type'''
|string
|minecraft:normal
|The preset for the generated world.

The vanilla namespace ({{cd|minecraft:}}) can be omitted.

:'''minecraft:normal''' - Standard world with hills, valleys, water, etc.
:'''[[Superflat|minecraft:flat]]''' - A flat world with no features. Can be modified with '''generator-settings'''.
:'''[[Large Biomes|minecraft:large_biomes]]''' - Same as default but all biomes are larger.
:'''[[Amplified|minecraft:amplified]]''' - Same as default but world-generation height limit is increased.
:'''[[Single Biome|minecraft:single_biome_surface]]''' - A buffet world which the entire overworld consists of one biome. Can be modified with '''generator-settings'''.

|- id="log-ips"
|'''log-ips'''
|boolean
|true
|Whether to show client IP addresses in messages printed to the server console or the log file.

|integer
|0
|Controls the port that the [[Minecraft Server Management Protocol]] is started.

|- id="management-server-secret"
|'''management-server-secret'''
|string
|''blank''
|Allows for clients to supply an {{cd|Authorization}} header with a server specific secret, which is forty alphanumeric characters long (A-Z, a-z, and 0-9).

The secret is automatically generated if the property is left empty.

|- id="management-server-tls-enabled"
|'''management-server-tls-enabled'''
|boolean
|true
|Controls whether the [[Minecraft Server Management Protocol]] uses TLS (Transport Layer Security) or not.

|- id="management-server-tls-keystore"
|'''management-server-tls-keystore'''
|string
|''blank''
|Controls the path to the keystore file used for TLS.

A server will not start is TLS is enabled and no keystore is provided.

|- id="management-server-tls-keystore-password"
|'''management-server-tls-keystore-password'''
|string
|''blank''
|Controls the password to the keystore file used for TLS.

The password can be done through an environment variable ({{cd|MINECRAFT_MANAGEMENT_TLS_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD}}), a Java Virtual Machine argument ({{cd|-Dmanagement.tls.keystore.password{{=}}}}), or through this server property.

|- id="max-chained-neighbor-updates"
|'''max-chained-neighbor-updates'''
|integer{{more info|the valid range}}
|1000000
|The limit of consecutive neighbor updates before skipping additional ones.

Negative values disable the limit.

|- id="max-players"
|'''max-players'''
|integer (0-(2^31 - 1))
|20
|The maximum number of players that can play on the server at the same time.

Ops with <code>bypassesPlayerLimit</code> enabled can join the server even if the server is full.{{verify}} Extremely large values for this field result in the client-side user list being broken.{{verify}}

|- id="max-tick-time"
|'''max-tick-time'''
|integer (-1 or 0–(2^63 - 1))
|60000
|The maximum number of milliseconds a single tick may take.

After this limit is exceeded, the server watchdog stops the server with the message, ''A single server tick took 60.00 seconds (should be max 0.05); Considering it to be crashed, server will forcibly shutdown.'' and exits with an exit code of 1.

:'''-1''' - disable watchdog entirely

|- id="max-world-size"
|'''max-world-size'''
|integer (1-29999984)
|29999984
|The amount of blocks from the center of the world where the [[world border]] appears.

Setting the world border bigger causes the commands to complete successfully but the actual border does not move past this block limit. Setting the max-world-size higher than the default doesn't do anything.{{verify}}

|- id="motd"
|'''motd'''
|string
|''A Minecraft Server''
|The message displayed in the server list of the client, below the server name.

*The MOTD supports [[Formatting codes#Use in server.properties and pack.mcmeta|color and formatting codes]].
*The MOTD supports non-ASCII characters, such as "♥".
*If the MOTD is over 59 characters, the server list may report a communication error.

|- id="network-compression-threshold"
|'''network-compression-threshold'''
|integer
|256
|How big should a packet be to be compressed.

Packets the size of this many bytes or more will be compressed. A lower threshold will compress more packets, but compressing small amounts of data might end up with a larger result than the source.

:'''-1''' - disable compression entirely
:'''0''' - compress everything

'''Note:''' The Ethernet spec requires that packets less than 64 bytes become padded to 64 bytes. Thus, setting a value lower than 64 may not be beneficial. It is also not recommended to exceed the MTU, typically 1500 bytes.

|- id="online-mode"
|'''online-mode'''
|boolean
|true
|Whether to only allow players verified with the ''Minecraft'' account database to join.

Set this to false only if the player's server is '''not''' connected to the Internet. Hackers with fake accounts can connect if this is set to false! If minecraft.net is down or inaccessible, no players can connect if this is set to true. Setting this variable to off purposely is called "cracking" a server, and servers that are present with online mode off are called "cracked" servers, allowing players with unlicensed copies of ''Minecraft'' to join.

:'''true''' - Enabled. The server assumes it has an Internet connection and checks every connecting player.
:'''false''' - Disabled. The server does not attempt to check connecting players.

|- id="op-permission-level"
|'''op-permission-level'''
|integer (0-4)
|4
|The default [[permission level]] for ops when using {{cmd|op}}.

|- id="pause-when-empty-seconds"

|How many seconds have to pass after no player has been online before the server is paused.

|- id="player-idle-timeout"
|'''player-idle-timeout'''
|integer
|0
|How many minutes does the player have to idle to be kicked from the server.

If set to 0, idle players are never kicked.

:'''Note:''' ''Idle time is reset when the server receives one of the following packets:''
:*[[Java Edition protocol#Player_Action|Player Action]]
:*[[Java Edition protocol#Use_Item|Use Item]]
:*[[Java Edition protocol#Use_Item_On|Use Item On]]
:*[[Java Edition protocol#Set_Held_Item_(serverbound)|Set Held Item]]

|25565
|The UDP port number query (see '''enable-query''') listens on.

|- id="rate-limit"
|'''rate-limit'''
|integer
|0
|The maximum amount of packets a player can send before getting kicked.

Setting to 0 disables this feature.

|- id="rcon.password"

|integer (1-(2^16 - 2))
|25575
|The TCP port number rcon listens on.

|- id="region-file-compression"
|'''region-file-compression'''
|string
|deflate
|The algorithm used for [[Region file format|compressing chunks in regions]].

Can be <code>deflate</code>, <code>lz4</code>, or <code>none</code>.

Chunks are not automatically recompressed when changed.

|- id="require-resource-pack"
|'''require-resource-pack'''
|boolean
|false
|Whether players are disconnected if they decline to use the resource pack.

|- id="resource-pack"
|'''resource-pack'''
|string
|''blank''
|The [[resource pack]] download URL.

The player may choose to download the resource pack when joining.

If this is empty, no resource pack is provided. The resource pack may not be larger than 250 MiB. Note that download success or failure is logged by the client, and not by the server.

|- id="resource-pack-id"
|'''resource-pack-id'''
|[[UUID]] in hyphenated hexadecimal format

A custom message to be shown on resource pack prompt when <code>require-resource-pack</code> is used.

Can be left empty for a default message. Expects chat component syntax, can contain multiple lines.

|- id="resource-pack-sha1"
|'''resource-pack-sha1'''
|string
|''blank''
|{{Anchor|resource-pack-hash}} An optional SHA-1 digest of the resource pack, in lowercase hexadecimal.

It is recommended to specify this, because it is used to verify the integrity of the resource pack.

'''Note:''' If the resource pack is any different, a yellow message "Invalid sha1 for resource-pack-sha1" appears in the console when the server starts.

|- id="server-ip"
|'''server-ip'''
|string
|''blank''
|The IP address the server listens on. If empty, the server listens on all available IP addresses.

It is recommended to leave this empty.

|- id="server-port"
|'''server-port'''
|integer (1-(2^16 - 2))
|25565
|The TCP port number the server listens on.

This port must be [[wikipedia:Port forwarding|forwarded]] if the server is hosted in a network using [[wikipedia:Network address translation|NAT]] (if the player has a home router/firewall).

|- id="simulation-distance"
|'''simulation-distance'''
|integer (3-32)
|10
|The maximum distance from players that living entities may be located in order to be updated by the server, measured in chunks in each direction of the player (radius, not diameter).

If entities are outside of this radius, then they are not ticked by the server and they are not visible to players.

''10 is the default/recommended. If the player has major lag, this value is recommended to be reduced.''

|- id="spawn-protection"
|'''spawn-protection'''
|integer
|16
|The side length of the square [[spawn protection]] area as 2''x''+1.

Setting this to 0 disables the spawn protection. A value of 1 protects a 3×3 square centered on the spawn point. 2 protects 5×5, 3 protects 7×7, etc. This option is not generated on the first server start and appears when the first player joins. If there are no [[Server#Managing_and_maintaining_a_server|ops]] set on the server, the spawn protection is disabled automatically as well.

|- id="status-heartbeat-interval"
|'''status-heartbeat-interval'''
|integer
|0
|Controls the intervals in which the management server sends heartbeat notifications to connected clients.<br />It is disabled by default.

|- id="sync-chunk-writes"
|'''sync-chunk-writes'''
|boolean
|true
|Whether to enable synchronous chunk writes. This prevents data loss and corruption after a crash.

This can slow down the server due to I/O slowdowns.
|- id="text-filtering-config"
|'''text-filtering-config'''
|{{more info needed}}
|''blank''
|Configuration for the chat filtering mechanism.

Used internally by [[Realms]], not announced by Mojang and likely not meant to be used outside it.

|- id="text-filtering-version"
|'''text-filtering-version'''
|integer
|0
|The version of the configuration format used for text-filtering-config.

Valid values are 0 and 1.

|- id="use-native-transport"
|'''use-native-transport'''
|boolean
|true
|Whether to use optimized packet sending/receiving on Linux.

:'''true''' - Enabled. Enable Linux packet sending/receiving optimization.
:'''false''' - Disabled. Disable Linux packet sending/receiving optimization.

|- id="view-distance"
|'''view-distance'''
|integer (3-32)
|10
|The amount of world data the server sends the client, measured in chunks in each direction of the player (radius, not diameter).

This determines the server-side viewing distance.

''10 is the default/recommended. If the player has major lag, this value is recommended to be reduced.''

|- id="white-list"
|'''white-list'''
|boolean
|false
|Whether the whitelist is enabled.

With a whitelist enabled, users not on the whitelist cannot connect. Intended for private servers, such as those for real-life friends or strangers carefully selected via an application process, for example.

:'''false''' - No white list is used.
:'''true''' - The file whitelist.json is used to generate the white list.

'''''Note:''''' ''Ops are automatically whitelisted, and there is no need to add them to the whitelist.''

==''Bedrock Edition''==

{{cd|server.properties}} is located in the current working directory of the server process. That means if the server is started from some directory, the file will be also placed in that directory.

A default file is shipped with the server software. The file shipped with Windows builds has CRLF line endings, while the one shipped with Linux builds has LF line endings.

The file is UTF-8 encoded text using syntax inspired by the Properties syntax used in Java Edition. It can be edited with a text editor, such as Notepad, TextEdit, Kate, nano or Vim.

The syntax generally consists of line (LF or CRLF) separated key-value pairs, separated by an <code>=</code> sign. The key is the setting identifier, and the value is used for that setting. Lines starting with <code>#</code> are comments and are ignored.

===Default content===

The following default {{cd|server.properties}} comes with the server software as of [[Bedrock Dedicated Server 1.21.92.1|1.21.92.1]]:

|boolean
|true
|If enabled, the server ensures that the client is logged in with the same IP address seen on Minecraft.net. This has caused problems for people trying to play on the same computer they are hosting the server on as the server sees the local IP address (127.0.0.1) while Minecraft.net sees the external IP address. It is recommended that this is enabled unless the player want to play on the player's server from the same computer the player is hosting it on.
